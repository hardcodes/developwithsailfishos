What's the correct way to report bugs?

A good question. IMHO IRC and mailing list (see section \nameref{subsubsec:community:sailfishos} on page \pageref{subsubsec:community:sailfishos}) are just temporary solutions. You can also write to \verb,developer-care@jolla.com, but right at the moment there is no developer-specific bug tracker.

There is a press release announcing a portal that should be implemented soon. \url{http://jolla.com/media/documents/131219_Press_Release.pdf}
