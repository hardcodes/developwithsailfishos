\section{Use your editor of choice}\label{sec:editorofchoice}
%
Now you are happy with coding for a device with SailfishOS and the SDK, API and all, but for some reason you want to use \emph{your} editor\footnote{notepad^^, vi, emacs, eclipse, named it.} of choice. Because you are used to it, never used something else, it's better, whatever.

Well, I don't know what editor you are using and providing instructions for all them seems unfeasible. Instead I will try to walk you through all the build/compile/steps on the command line. This way you can see what's really happening behind the scenes and can integrate those steps into the environment of your choice. There are at least two ways to do this. First is the way QtCreator goes: call wrapper scripts. The second is to really walk barefooted.
