\section{QML}

At the beginning I've planned to give a little introduction into QML to get you starting but recently I have discovered a much better online resource\cite{qml01}. No need to reinvent the wheel here. Just go there and have a look, it's great!

Of course you should also look at \cite{qt05} and \cite{qt06}. If you want to have look beyond one's own nose, go and look at the resources that BlackBerry provide\cite{bb01}. Even if you can not use the information 1:1, it's a fairly good documentation of the usage from QML and C++.
