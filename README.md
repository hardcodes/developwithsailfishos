Developing with SailfishOS - a short introduction

This repository contains the LaTeX source files and the resulting PDF "Developing with SailfishOS". Criticism, suggestions and contribution welcome. I've already heard that it might be better to use another markup language to lower the barrier. LaTeX can be a little beast. Currently I am not sure which language to choose.
Candidates (at the moment) are:

# org-mode
# markdown
# MultiMarkDown
