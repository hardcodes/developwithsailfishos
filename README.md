Developing with SailfishOS - a short introduction

Just the PDF, please
--------------------

No problem, just head to http://hardcodes.de/SailfishOS/Developing-with-SailfishOS.pdf
*Note*: the latest and greatest version is always to be found here, of course.

This repository contains the LaTeX source files and the resulting PDF "Developing with SailfishOS". Criticism, errors, suggestions and contribution welcome. I've already heard that it might be better to use another markup language to lower the barrier. LaTeX can be a little beast.
Candidates (at the moment) are:

* org-mode (There are only 10 kinds of people: those who live in Emacs and those who don't. I for myself belong to the latter kind. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Emacs, I've just never used it, that's all. And if I want to lower the barrier for contribution, I should not force Emacs on the people)
* MarkDown (Easy markup language. Fullstop. Made for the web, IMHO not enough to produce a PDF file)
* MultiMarkDown (my candidate of choice, can be as easy as MarkDown but offers more options to produce printable documents. MarkDown and MultiMarkDown have the advantage that they can be written with any editor and the result can still be human readable)

So in future you might want to head over to http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/ for the tools and look at https://rawgithub.com/fletcher/human-markdown-reference/master/index.html for the syntax.
Before I start converting the document, I want to add some topics that spin around in my head right now. Yes, the more I add, the more needs to be converted... As of now the document already got its raw structure and is split up in several sub-documents, so that I don't have to work on one big chunk of text.
