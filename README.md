Developing with SailfishOS - a short introduction

Just the PDF, please
--------------------

No problem, just head to http://hardcodes.de/SailfishOS/Developing-with-SailfishOS.pdf

This repository contains the LaTeX source files and the resulting PDF "Developing with SailfishOS". Criticism, suggestions and contribution welcome. I've already heard that it might be better to use another markup language to lower the barrier. LaTeX can be a little beast. Currently I am not sure which language to choose.
Candidates (at the moment) are:

* org-mode
* markdown
* MultiMarkDown

Before I choose the alternative and convert the document, I want to add some topics that spin around in my head right now. After that I will start to add some structure into the graphic resources, having them all in one folder was not the most clever decission^^.
